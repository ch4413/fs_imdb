### Task

1. Download IMDb review dataset from http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
2. Write a small python package to train a classifier to classify reviews into two classes {positive: aclImdb/train/pos, negative: aclImdb/train/neg}. We would encourage you to follow best dev practices:
* modules
* tests
* setup, etc.
* We would also encourage you to use git.
* It is possible to use language of your choice other than python for the task, however we would need you to justify it.
3. How would you put your model in production? What metrics would you monitor to ensure that model works good? Implement model productionalization bits in the same package.
4. Document python package and model results. What is great about your system? What issues need to be addressed? What would you do next if you had more time?
